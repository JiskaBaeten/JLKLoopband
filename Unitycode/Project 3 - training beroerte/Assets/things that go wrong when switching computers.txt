All models reload + materials in the folder they're in

For fountain:
in shader normal maps, just place fountaintexBump

for trees and bushes;
in shader set rendering mode to cutout

the bump maps for the kibbles (doggiebowl)
normal (20)+ height map (0.08)


==> consider trying to put models + materials in 1 folder??
